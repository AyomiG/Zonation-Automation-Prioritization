# Zonation-Automation-Prioritization
Batch-processing for multi-species conservation planning and spatial prioritization using Zonation5

Zonation5 Automation: PA Suitability Filtering Framework
Developed by Oluwadamilola Ogundipe and Oluwaseun Ojeleye

Overview
This framework automates multi-species spatial prioritization using Zonation5 (CAZ1). It streamlines the application of species-specific suitability filters to Protected Area (PA) networks, allowing for batch processing of large datasets.

Masking & Definitions
The script facilitates three distinct conservation scenarios by filtering the PA network based on suitability scores:

Global: Includes all Protected Areas within the study region regardless of specific suitability.

75th Percentile (Local): Filters the PA network to include only areas meeting the 75th suitability percentile for the target species.

Average (Local Avg): Filters the PA network to include only areas meeting the average suitability threshold for the target species.

How to Use
Preparation: Ensure Zonation5 is installed at C:\Program Files (x86)\Zonation5\.

Input Data: Place your species lists (.txt) in bin_file/ and your mask files (.tif) in AI_75/ or AI_avg/.

Configuration: Open Zonation_Automation.bat and set the MODE variable to global, local, or local_avg.

Run: Double-click the .bat file. The script will automatically create an Output folder with results for every species list.

Directory Structure
bin_file/: Species input lists.

AI_75/: Hierarchical mask layer for 75th percentile criteria.

AI_avg/: Hierarchical mask layer for average suitability criteria.

Output/: Results generated by the script.
